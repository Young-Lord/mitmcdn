# HTML rewrite plugins
# - Place plugin entry files in ./plugins/*.ts
# - Each plugin reads its config from ./configs/{plugin_name}/config.toml
#
# Example YouTube plugin config path:
#   ./configs/youtube_embed_cache/config.toml
#
# yt-dlp command is configured in that plugin config:
#   yt_dlp_command = ["yt-dlp", "--cookies-from-browser", "firefox"]
